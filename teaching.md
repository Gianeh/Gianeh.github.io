## Galileo Galilei Highschool Extracurricular
Since this year, 2024, in November I started teaching a *free* extracurricular course on **Informatics Fundamentals** at "Liceo Galileo Galilei" in Siena.
At this [page](https://gianeh.github.com/pages/teaching.html), you can find a list of lectures and topics regarding the students' activities throughout the course.
This section is designed specifically to keep track of topics I told at lectures, for this reason the following page is in Italian language only!
