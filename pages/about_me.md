A big HI to everyone reading! I'm Pietro, a tech enthusiast and AI student at the University of Siena, Department of Information Engineering and Mathematical Sciences [DIISM](https://artificial-intelligence-automation.unisi.it/en). It seems like you've landed on my portfolio!

On this page, you’ll find a brief description of my past collaborations and a short biography. To view my humble projects, please browse this website from its [home](../index.html) (but keep in mind it's still heavily **under construction** and subject to structural changes).

## About Me - as a Computer Engineer
I've been a passionate student and an everyday learner, but most importantly a **curious individual**, for as long as I can remember. My first contact with the digital world happened at age 4, thanks to my father's experiments with an old arcade game emulator called "MAME 32."

A few years later, I received a mediocre laptop as a gift. My interest in how computers work—and how to harness the endless possibilities they offer—only grew from there. Around age 12, I begged my parents to upgrade my hardware to support my interest in modern video games, a passion I still pursue today.

Meanwhile, I began to develop a particular interest in programming logic and scripting, an interest that would take real shape around age 17.

The very first "programming language" I learned was Python, which directed my career goals firmly toward software development! However, at that time, I wasn’t very familiar with algorithms or computer science in general. Nonetheless, spurred on by the Dunning-Kruger effect and inspired by Reinforcement Learning demos I saw online, I began my journey as a Computer Engineering student.

**Oh my...** In those first three years, I explored a vast array of topics in electronics and information science. New horizons opened my mind to new possibilities and inevitably closed it to others. I delved into computer architectures and low-level programming, from C and C++ to a taste of RISC-V Assembly, explored network architectures, and studied both modern and legacy operating systems. Most importantly, I rekindled an old passion for mathematics, especially in the context of optimization and game theory.

My passion for software development has kept pace, and after completing my BSc with top marks and on time, I am now pursuing an MSc in [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.unisi.it/ugov/degree/16834) at the same university. Currently, I’m 24 and in my second year (meanwhile I accepted a position in Barcelona as a Research Engineer at [BSC](https://bsc.es)), and new opportunities are sprouting in every direction. Every day, new projects await, and I feel ready to embark on as many as possible, meet passionate people, and "skyrocket" my career in the vibrant community of Computer Science and Engineering! ;)

## About Me - as a Person
As stated above, I'm a very curious person, a quality I feel confident recognizing in others and believe to be essential for any intellectual human activity. This principal aspect forced me through the exploration of a variety of subjects I considered of interest, spanning from the obvious computer science, to human anatomy and fitness training, nutrition, videogames, cult and modern literature (take a look at my personal [library](/pages/library.html)) and philosophy.

I consider myself a dreamer, always eager to tell stories on topics that fascinate me, but I most often am a good listener too. I'm particularly proud of my **friends** and of my extended network. I'm strongly convinced to be able to create great bounds with emphatic and curious people from every community. I can work in a deep focus but I definitely give my best in a team.

My takes can be strong and my opinions well formed on many of the commonly asked topics, nonetheless I'm a really open minded person, convincing me requires nothing more than facts, logic or empathy. When approaching new arguments I see myself as a humble person well convinced of his domain skills and always ready to learn more through every step.
