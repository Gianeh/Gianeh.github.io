# SFML Sorting Visualization

Realized as a University assignment, this project was my first step into the world of C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). It was an icebreaker that helped me explore object-oriented programming and graphical applications in a fun and creative way.

Inspired by similar projects I found online, I created a simple visualization of sorting algorithms. I even dreamed of adding audio and more features like some of the [other visualizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg), but life got in the way. Still, Iâ€™m very proud of this early adventure into graphical programming with C++.
