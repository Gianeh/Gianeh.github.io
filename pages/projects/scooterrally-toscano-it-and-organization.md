# Scooterraly Toscano

With my father's passion for Vespa and Lambretta scooters and my IT curriculum, came the responsibility and honor to co-organize one of the **most important European events** in the field. Green Onions (my dad's) scooterclub resurrected the Rally after 12 years in the usual location of Isola d'Elba and thousands of aficionados traveled hundreds and thousands km to come.

## Event presentation and showcase
