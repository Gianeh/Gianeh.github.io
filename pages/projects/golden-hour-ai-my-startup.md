# Golden Hour AI — My Startup Journey

Around the beginning of the 2024/2025 academic year I returned to my old high school to help run an extracurricular computer‑science course.  There I met **[Simone Mattera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/s-mattera)**, who was looking for a technological partner to bring his vision of AI‑powered hospitality to life.  Out of that meeting Golden Hour AI was born, with Simone as CEO and myself taking on the CTO role.

## What we build

Golden Hour AI develops custom large‑language‑model chatbots tailored to **agriturismi and hotels in and around Siena**.  Our agents are trained on:

* each property’s tone of voice, amenities and local experiences;
* multilingual FAQs (Italian, English, German and French to start);
* dynamic data such as availability, weather suggestions and local events.

These chatbots can be embedded on a property’s website or WhatsApp Business account, providing 24/7 answers that:

| Benefit                        | Impact                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reduce email / phone load**  | Staff can focus on personalised service instead of repetitive questions                    |
| **Upsell local experiences**   | The agent suggests tastings, tours and add‑ons based on the guest’s interests              |
| **Capture bookings faster**    | Real‑time room availability and instant follow‑up links drive direct reservations          |
| **Treasure the “golden hour”** | Quick, accurate replies during the first hour of interest dramatically increase conversion |

## Why Siena first?

Siena’s countryside hosts hundreds of family‑run agriturismi that compete on charm, not chain‑level budgets.  By focusing locally we can iterate closely with owners, integrate hyper‑local knowledge (wineries, events, hiking routes) and build a reference network before scaling to the broader Tuscan and Italian hospitality market.

## Status and next steps

* **Pilot 1** (Q3 2025) → One agriturismo and One B&B live with our web widget integration.
* **Pilot 2** (Q4 2025) → First important client and partnership (already acquired) - [Note del Chianti](https://www.notedelchianti.com/).
* **Seed round** (Early 2026) → Scaling up with collabs in Tuscany and around Italy

> *“Our mission is to let small hospitality businesses offer concierge‑level service, even at midnight, in any language.”*
