# Scooterrally Toscano
Inspired by my father’s passion for Vespa and Lambretta scooters—and building on my own IT experience—I have had the honor and responsibility of co-organizing one of the most prominent European scooter rallies. The Green Onions Scooter Club (founded by my father) recently revived the tradition of hosting the event on Isola d’Elba, and, for the second consecutive year, we welcomed scooter enthusiasts from all over Europe.

## Event Presentation and Experience
It’s hard to fully express the atmosphere and joy that this event creates among participants. If you’re curious about the world of classic scooters or want to see more, I invite you to check out this [showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KUl-6IzGH0) and this [review](https://www.sip-scootershop.com/it/blog/scooter-rally-toscano-2025_p4291).

For the second year in a row, I contributed to both the technical and organizational aspects, working alongside a passionate team to ensure another successful edition.
