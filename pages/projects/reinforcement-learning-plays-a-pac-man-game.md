# Auto Pac-man

This University project aimed at showing the capability of relatively simple Deep Reinforcement Learning strategies to leverage some degrees of generalization and beat complex scenarios (for reference the shown .gif illustrates a map that could assume **402373850572643891934879041340755140 or 4.0 x 10^36, possible states**), whereas simpler or even trivial solutions offered by Dynamic Programming and Q-Learning could at most beat games with 4 candies and 1 ghost in smaller maps.

Along with the **3 branches** of the code in the respective iterations of the algorithms, a detailed [mathematical formulation of the game](https://github.com/Gianeh/auto-pac-man/blob/neural_rl/Pac-man_model.pdf) is provided, including a sophisticated set of formulas to account for the number of possible of states and terminal states in a Pac-man game without "special candies".
