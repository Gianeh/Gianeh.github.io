# BiGraFo Platform – System Administration and Deployment
This project documents my work as a scientific IT collaborator for BiGraFo, a research initiative based at the University of Siena and powered by the Omeka Semantic CMS. The experience allowed me to develop my technical skills and contribute to a collaborative research effort.

## Collaboration
I was engaged as an external professional, working closely with the project coordinator and the BiGraFo team. My responsibilities centered on the technical management and migration of the platform, especially during a challenging period following a cybersecurity incident at the university. Throughout the project, I provided regular updates and submitted a comprehensive final report.

## Technical Activities
Installed and configured Apache HTTP Server, PHP (with necessary libraries and extensions), and MySQL.

Managed the migration of the MySQL database from an external Aruba server to the university’s infrastructure.

Deployed Omeka S, configuring the main database and upgrading compatible modules.

Helped ensure the platform’s stability and availability during and after migration.

## Challenges and Results
A key part of the assignment was to respond quickly to the need for platform migration after a *cyberattack affected the university*. I supported the transfer from an external hosting provider to a dedicated university server (digilet.unisi.it), helping restore secure and stable operations.

## Outcome
The BiGraFo platform is now fully operational within the university’s digital infrastructure. All goals of my assignment were achieved, and I am grateful for the chance to have contributed to this collaborative project.
